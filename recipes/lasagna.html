    <p>Lasagna is a <strong>wide</strong>, flat sheet of pasta.</p>
    <p>To make a classic lasagna, start by preparing the meat sauce. Cook 1 lb of ground beef, 1 lb of Italian sausage, and a chopped onion in a large pot over medium heat until browned, then add 4 minced garlic cloves. Stir in two 28 oz cans of crushed tomatoes, two 6 oz cans of tomato paste, two 15 oz cans of tomato sauce, and 1/2 cup of red wine if desired. Season with 1/4 cup each of chopped fresh basil and parsley, 1 tbsp sugar, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp black pepper, 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes, and 1 tsp dried oregano. Let the sauce simmer uncovered for at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the cheese filling by mixing 2 cups of ricotta cheese with an egg, 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley, 1/2 tsp salt, and 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg. Cook 12 lasagna noodles according to package instructions, drain, and lay them flat to prevent sticking.</p>
    <p>To assemble the lasagna, preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C) and spread a thin layer of meat sauce in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Layer 4 lasagna noodles over the sauce, followed by one-third of the ricotta mixture, one-third of 4 cups of shredded mozzarella cheese, and one-third of the meat sauce. Repeat the layers two more times, finishing with meat sauce on top and sprinkling 1 cup of grated Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil and bake for 25 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for another 25 minutes until bubbly and golden brown. Let it cool for 15 minutes before serving.</p>
