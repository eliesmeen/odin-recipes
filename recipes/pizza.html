    <p>Pizza is a flat, open-faced <em>Italian</em> dish of bread dough topped with spiced tomato sauce and cheese, and often garnished with other toppings</p>
    <p>To make a classic homemade pizza, start by preparing the dough. In a large bowl, combine 2 1/4 tsp of active dry yeast, 1 1/2 cups of warm water, and 1 tsp of sugar. Let it sit for about 10 minutes until frothy. Add 3 1/2 to 4 cups of all-purpose flour, 2 tbsp of olive oil, and 1 tsp of salt. Mix until a dough forms, then knead on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours or until doubled in size.</p>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). Punch down the dough and divide it into two portions. Roll each portion into a 12-inch circle and place them on greased baking sheets or pizza stones. Spread 1/2 cup of pizza sauce over each dough circle, leaving a small border. Sprinkle 2 cups of shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce on each pizza. Add your favorite toppings, such as pepperoni, bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, and olives. Bake each pizza for about 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned. Let the pizzas cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.</p>
