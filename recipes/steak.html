    <p>A steak is a thick cut of meat generally sliced across the muscle fibers, sometimes including a bone.</p>
    <p>To prepare a perfect steak, start by letting your steak (ribeye, sirloin, or your preferred cut) come to room temperature for about 30 minutes. Pat it dry with paper towels and rub both sides with olive oil. Generously season the steak with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Preheat a heavy skillet, preferably cast iron, over high heat until it’s very hot.</p>
    <p>Place the steak in the hot skillet and cook for 3-4 minutes per side for medium-rare, adjusting the time for your desired level of doneness. For thicker steaks, finish cooking in a preheated oven at 400°F (200°C) for a few additional minutes. Once cooked, remove the steak from the skillet and let it rest on a cutting board for 5-10 minutes to allow the juices to redistribute. Slice against the grain and serve immediately.</p>
